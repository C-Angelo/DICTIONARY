MINI COMPUTER DICTIONARY USING THONNY - IPO FRAMEWORK WITHOUT USING "if-else statements"

DESCRIPTION: I use Thonny as my coding software, and this is where I created my first mini computer dictionary, which contains 30 terms with their definitions. I used the IPO framework to keep the process organized. In simple terms, the input consists of clear terms and definitions, the process involves the step-by-step execution of the dictionary program, and the output shows the resultâ€”whether it works or not. As simple as that! Also, take note that as a programmer, especially if you're a beginner, it's important to carefully study and analyze the code to check for any errors.
